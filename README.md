## Problem Statement: Modernizing the RGUKT Hostel Complaint System

### Overview:
Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (RGUKT) provides hostel facilities to its students, but the current complaint system relies heavily on manual processes. Students are required to visit caretakers physically to lodge complaints regarding various hostel-related issues. This traditional approach not only consumes valuable time for both students and caretakers but also lacks efficiency in handling and tracking complaints promptly.

### Challenge:
The challenge is to develop an IT solution that modernizes the RGUKT hostel complaint system, making it more efficient, accessible, and user-friendly. The solution should aim to streamline the complaint submission process, enhance communication between students and caretakers, and provide administrators with better tools for managing complaints effectively.

### Objectives:
- **Automation**: Implement a system that allows students to submit complaints digitally, eliminating the need for physical visits to caretakers.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the solution is accessible from various devices such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets, catering to the diverse needs of students.
- **Transparency**: Provide real-time updates on the status of complaints to students, giving them visibility into the resolution process.
- **Efficiency**: Optimize the complaint management workflow to ensure quick and effective resolution of issues raised by students.
- **Analytics**: Optionally, incorporate data analysis capabilities to identify common complaints trends, enabling proactive measures to address recurring issues.
  
### Features:
1. **User Authentication**: Secure login/authentication system for students and caretakers to access the complaint platform.
2. **Complaint Submission**: User-friendly interface for students to submit complaints, including options to categorize the type of issue and attach relevant details.
3. **Dashboard**: Personalized dashboard for students and caretakers to view active and resolved complaints, along with their status.
4. **Notification System**: Automated notifications via email or SMS to update users on the progress of their complaints.
5. **Escalation Mechanism**: Provision for escalating unresolved complaints to higher authorities for prompt attention.
6. **Analytics Dashboard** (Optional): Insights and analytics dashboard for administrators to visualize complaint trends, monitor performance metrics, and make data-driven decisions.
  
### Technologies:
Participants are encouraged to leverage a wide range of technologies, including but not limited to:
- Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, etc.
- Mobile App Development: iOS, Android, Flutter, React Native, etc.
- Backend Development: Node.js, Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails, etc.
- Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase, etc.
- Machine Learning & Data Science: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Sentiment Analysis, Predictive Analytics, etc.

### Evaluation Criteria:
Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- **Functionality**: Does the solution meet the specified objectives? Is it user-friendly and intuitive?
- **Innovation**: Does the solution incorporate innovative features or approaches to address the problem effectively?
- **Scalability**: Is the solution scalable to accommodate a large user base and handle increasing complaint volumes?
- **Reliability**: Is the system robust and reliable, ensuring smooth operation without frequent disruptions?
- **Impact**: What potential impact does the solution have on improving the hostel complaint management process at RGUKT?

### Deliverables:
Participants are required to submit the following deliverables:
- Fully functional prototype of the complaint management system.
- Documentation outlining the system architecture, design decisions, and instructions for deployment.

### Conclusion:
By modernizing the RGUKT hostel complaint system, we aim to enhance the overall hostel experience for students and improve the efficiency of complaint resolution processes. We look forward to innovative solutions that leverage technology to address this challenge and make a meaningful impact on campus life.
